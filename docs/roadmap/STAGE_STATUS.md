## Status by Stage

### Stage 0. Architecture Freeze

Status: `done`

Done:
- master migration plan exists
- repo strategy is fixed
- target architecture is fixed
- wave/segment delegation model is fixed

Remaining:
- none

### Stage 1. Internal Decoupling

Status: `done`

Done:
- `packages/app-core` seed extraction
- `packages/sdk` seed extraction
- `packages/ui` seed extraction
- `@app-core/*`, `@sdk/*`, `@ui/*`
- shim/re-export layer in old paths
- `AuthProvider` contract
- `StorageProvider` contract
- `MediaProvider` contract
- `RealtimeProvider` contract

Remaining:
- none at contract-definition level

### Stage 2. Nest Foundation

Status: `done`

Done:
- `apps/api`
- `Nest` skeleton
- config/logger/health
- base module scaffold
- realtime scaffold

Remaining:
- none at foundation level

### Stage 3. Domain and Realtime Extraction

Status: `done`

Done:
- first backend-owned slice moved to `apps/api`: invites/servers/channels/members
- `src/app/api/*` for this slice converted to compatibility/proxy layer
- `src/pages/api/socket/*` for this slice reduced to transitional auth/proxy ownership
- transitional cleanup for the same slice completed
- proxy response handling in legacy `pages/api/socket/*` aligned through a shared helper
- remaining channel validation removed from legacy socket layer so ownership stays in `apps/api`
- realtime contract for the first slice centralized in `packages/app-core`
- client listeners for the first slice aligned to the shared realtime contract
- second backend-owned slice started in `apps/api`: messages/direct-messages
- `src/app/api/messages/*` and `src/app/api/direct-messages/*` reduced to compatibility/proxy ownership
- `src/pages/api/socket/messages/*` and `src/pages/api/socket/direct-messages/*` reduced to transitional auth/proxy ownership
- realtime contract for the message slice centralized in `packages/app-core`
- socket transport ownership moved from legacy `pages/api/socket/*` into the backend realtime gateway
- `Nest` realtime gateway is now the transport owner
- web runtime connects directly to backend realtime transport
- legacy `src/pages/api/socket/*` no longer owns socket emit behavior

Remaining:
- non-blocking transitional cleanup only
- auth/profile resolution is still transitional and still belongs to a later stage

### Stage 4. Auth Replacement Path

Status: `in progress`

Done:
- backend auth foundation exists in `apps/api`
- a centralized auth service resolves transitional auth context
- reusable guards and decorators replace direct `x-profile-id` reads in backend controllers
- backend-owned `/api/auth/session` snapshot endpoint exists
- domain backend modules now depend on the auth boundary instead of raw header access
- backend can resolve session/profile by user identity through the auth boundary
- `currentProfile()` and `currentProfilePages()` now use the backend auth boundary as the primary path
- direct active-flow `ensureProfile()` ownership is removed from current profile resolution
- `src/app/api/*` proxy routes now use backend-auth headers instead of manual `x-profile-id` glue
- `src/pages/api/socket/*` proxy routes now use backend-auth headers instead of manual `x-profile-id` glue
- middleware auth wiring now goes through a local auth adapter instead of direct Clerk middleware usage
- layout/provider runtime auth wiring now goes through a local auth provider boundary
- the current runtime auth state/identity loading is centralized in runtime auth utilities
- backend-owned auth session persistence exists
- backend session refresh/rotation/revocation now goes through the persisted auth-session state
- backend cookie transport foundation exists for browser auth: exchange/refresh/logout can set or clear `Secure` + `HttpOnly` session cookies
- auth context resolution can now be authenticated by cookie-backed access token as well as transitional headers
- browser/runtime auth can now bootstrap and clear backend cookie sessions through dedicated auth routes
- the current runtime profile / session resolution prefers backend cookie-session auth before falling back to transitional Clerk-backed identity resolution
- runtime provider and middleware are integrated with the backend cookie-session path as the primary browser auth flow
- backend-owned auth identity foundation exists
- Clerk identity resolution now goes through backend auth-identity ownership instead of direct profile upsert logic
- password hashing/verification foundation exists in the backend auth boundary
- backend password-based register/login endpoints now exist on top of the backend session/cookie model
- browser/runtime auth entrypoints now use backend-owned login/register flow as the primary path
- sign-in/sign-up pages now prefer local auth entrypoint forms with Clerk left as fallback mode
- shared auth entrypoint validation is centralized through app-core schema/contracts

Remaining:
- local auth adapter layer still uses `Clerk` internally as the transitional identity/auth source
- full `Clerk` replacement
- transitional `Clerk` provider/middleware/runtime glue still exists in the app shell
- backend-owned devices/session-management surface is still incomplete
- auth product completeness (`email verification`, `password reset`, account-linking policy) is still pending after provider replacement

## Next Correct Step

The next correct step by plan is:

1. continue `Stage 4` with final `Clerk` removal and cleanup of transitional auth wiring
2. keep this focused on the auth boundary only
3. do not mix this with storage, `Postgres`, or `LiveKit/media` migrations
